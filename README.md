# Arduino Powered Christmas Lights
Our first Christmas in my parents new house lacked a Christmas tree, so we built one along with all its decorations. This is the code for the fairy lights I made. They flash the message "Merry Christmas" in morse code using flashes for shorts and pulses for longs.

## Tree in Action

## Schematic
The circuit uses a NPN transistor as a low-side switch, I couldn't have been bothered to look up the max current of the Arduino, so I added the switch, probably wan't nececarry. I used a single resistor on the LED chain, so LED colours that had a higher voltage drop looked a bit dimmer.
